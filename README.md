 <h5>Welcome To My First Ever Project!! </h5>
<p>
 This project was an exciting challenge that allowed me to showcase my skills in front-end web development and JavaScript programming. The game features classic gameplay mechanics, with players tasked with defending Earth from an alien invasion. The game's logic was implemented in JavaScript, Building this project was a rewarding experience that allowed me to push the limits of what can be achieved using only web technologies, and I'm excited to share it with the world.
